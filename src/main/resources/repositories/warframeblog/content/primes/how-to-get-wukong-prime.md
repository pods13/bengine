<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>Wukong Prime</strong> along with Zhuge Prime and Ninkondi Prime have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing you which relics you'll need to farm to get Wukong Prime and where you can farm these relics. </p><!--more--><h2>Wukong Prime Relics</h2><p>So, Wukong Prime parts scattered across four different relics:</p><ul><li><b>Axi G2</b> that drops Wukong Prime Neuroptics Blueprint</li><li><b>Lith W1</b> that drops Wukong Prime Blueprint</li><li><b>Meso K2</b> that drops Wukong Prime Systems Blueprint</li><li><b>Neo S12</b> that drops Wukong Prime Chassis Blueprint</li></ul><h2>Wukong Prime Relics Farming</h2><p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on my personal experience <strong>farming Wukong Prime relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance. Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm Wukong Prime relics</strong> fast and easy.</p><h3>How To Get Wukong Prime Neuroptics Relics</h3><p>For <b>Axi G2 Relics farming</b> I would recommend <b>Xini on Eris</b>. It's an interception mission that's pretty straightforward. The first two rounds drop Neo relics and rounds 3 and 4 regularly dropping Axi relics. Optimally you want to stay four rounds before extracting.</p><p>Xini also has a high Neurodes drop, so be sure to keep an eye for [Neurodes](/warframe-neurodes-farming/ "Warframe Neurodes Farming").</p><h3>How To Get Wukong Prime Blueprint Relics</h3><p>For <strong>farming Lith W1 Relics</strong> the <b>Orokin Derelict Defense</b> mission is a great option. ODD is a straightforward defense mission that you can even solo with Banshee and you should be able to get two Lith relics in 10 waves most of the time.</p><h3>How To Get Wukong Prime Systems Relics</h3><p>In order to farm <b>Meso K2 Relics</b>, I would recommend <b>IO on Jupiter</b>. This mission can be completed really quickly and with some luck, you should be able to get two Meso relics in 10 waves.</p><h3>How To Get Wukong Prime Chassis Relics</h3><p>For <b>Neo S12 Relics</b>, my recommendation is <b>Hydron on Sedna</b>. It is the fastest way to farm for Neo relics because Neo relics drop every 5 rounds. Also, it worth mentioned that Hydron is the best area to level up your Warframe and weapons. So, don't forget to bring alongside your weapons that you want to level up.</p><p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new Wukong Prime relics.</p><p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>Wukong Prime Relics farming</strong>. I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>

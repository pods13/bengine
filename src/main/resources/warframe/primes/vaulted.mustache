<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>{{ name }}</strong> along with
    {{& join alongWithPrimeItems delimiter=" and " lambda=toPrimeItemLink}}
    have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.</p><!--more-->
<h2>{{name}} Vaulted</h2>
<p>Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced
    the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the {{name}} from
    the drop table. So, currently {{name}} is inaccessible for some period of time. An important
    thing to remember here though is that while {{name}} relics were moved over to the Prime Vault
    and made inaccessible, any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the
    Prime Vault will stay.</p>
<h2>How To Get {{name}}</h2>
<p>So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:</p>
<ul>
    {{#each itemPartsToAllRelics.entrySet}}
        <li>
            <b>{{join value delimiter=", "}}</b> that drop{{#isEq value.size 1}}s{{/isEq}} {{key}}
        </li>
    {{/each}}
</ul>
<p>If you don't have any of them then either you could buy {{name}} Relics from other players or wait
    until the {{name}} eventually returns when the Prime Vault opens again.</p>

<p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>How To Get {{name}}</strong>.
    I hope this guide helped and let's hope {{name}} will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.</p>

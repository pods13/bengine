<p>Hey guys. And the <strong>{{ name }}</strong> along with
    {{& join alongWithPrimeItems delimiter=" and " lambda=toPrimeItemLink}} have arrived in Warframe. Today I'll be showing
    you which relics you'll need to farm to get {{ name }} and where you can farm these relics.</p><!--more-->

<h2>{{ name }} Relics</h2>

<p>So, {{ name }} parts scattered across {{numberOfRelics itemPartsToAvailableRelics}} different relics:</p>
<ul>
    {{#each itemPartsToAvailableRelics.entrySet}}
        <li>
            <b>{{join value delimiter=", "}}</b> that drop{{#isEq value.size 1}}s{{/isEq}} {{key}}
        </li>
    {{/each}}
</ul>

<h2>{{ name }} Relics Farming</h2>
<p>Before we proceed any further, I would like to say that all spots that I'll share with you are based on
    my personal experience <strong>farming {{name}} relics</strong>. The spots gave me the necessary relics
    at the shortest time, but you may have a different result as relic drops are also based on a chance.
    Now, let's get on to the <strong>how to farm {{name}} relics</strong> fast and easy.</p>
{{#each itemPartFarmingLocations}}
    <h3>How To Get {{join itemPartNames delimiter=" & "}} Relics</h3>
    {{#each farmingLocations}}
        {{^mentionedIn}}
            {{include "partials/eras/" era}}
        {{/mentionedIn}}
        {{include "partials/mentioned"}}
    {{/each}}
{{/each}}

{{include "partials/bounties"}}

<p>Finally, relic packs always a decent way to get your hands on those new {{name}} relics.</p>
<p>And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about <strong>{{name}} Relics Farming</strong>.
    I hope this guide helped and good luck with farming. Bye-bye.</p>
